				<h1>I単upiaq Numbers Information</h1>

				<p>This is a preliminary source of information about the I単upiaq vocabulary for numbers, as well as my (very, very preliminary) program for practicing this vocabulary. The program includes modes vocabulary and basic math operations using Kaktovik numerals. Additions and refinement to both the information and the program will occur as time permits. The program is available in certain information sections, as well as the link at the bottom.</p>

					<h3><a href="contentpages/games.html">Browser Games</a></h3>
					<p>These are the games that I have developed for Kaktovik numerals (so far). These have been tested with Google Chrome and very little else so far. They are also not optimized for mobile at all at the moment.</p>
