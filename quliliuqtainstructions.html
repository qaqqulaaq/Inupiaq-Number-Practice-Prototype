	<h1>Instructions for Quliliuqta</h1>
	<p>This is a super early electronic version of the Quliliuqta card game and its variants</p>
	
	<p>The goal of the game is to select numbers to build ten if playing Quliuta, five if playing Tallimaliuta or twenty if playing Iñuiññaliuqta. Every card that you select in the process of building five will be worth one point.</p>
	
	<p>To draw a card, click on the deck in the bottom right of the screen. If you click the deck when it is possible to build the target number, the computer will collect them instead, with you earning no points for it.</p>
	
	<p>There are sixty cards in the deck. Once all of the cards are drawn, you may click on the outline where the deck was to restart the game.</p>
