	<h1>Instructions for Talliliuqta</h1>
	<p>This is a super early electronic version of the Quliliuqta card game, currently including only half of the deck (hence the Talliliuqta)</p>
	
	<p>The goal of the game is to select numbers to build five. Every card that you select in the process of building five will be worth one point.</p>
	
	<p>To draw a card, click on the deck in the bottom right of the screen. If you click the deck when it is possible to build five, the computer will collect them instead, with you earning no points for it.</p>
	
	<p>There are sixty cards in the deck. Once all of the cards are drawn, you may click on the outline where the deck was to restart the game.</p>
